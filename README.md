# FFTMC-Avisynth
Motion Compensated FFT3D Denoiser.

Requirements:

Avisynth 2.6 or higher 

fft3dfilter

MVTOOLS2 2.6.05 or higher

function fftmc(clip input, float "sigma", float "beta", int "mthresh", int "blocksize", int "overlap", float "sharpen", clip "auxclip" )

Sigma-Denoising Strength

Beta-Noise margin.
Control noise amount left in the restoration for Wiener filter.
1.0 for no noise left.

Mthresh-Motion Threshold
The cutoff point for denoising.
Anything above this threshold will not be denoised.

Blocksize-Determines how large the blocks generated by MVTOOLS should be.
Should be 4,8,16,32, or 64.

Overlap-Determines how much overlap of the blocks there is.
Default size should be half of the blocksize.

Sharpen-Option to sharpen clip.

Auxclip-Auxiliary Clip.
Option to feed MVTOOLS an already denoised clip for motion vector generation.
